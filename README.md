# I am dejaguarkyng.

*Not a product of encouragement. A product of being told I couldn't.*

### The world gave me closed doors. So I learned to write my own.

I don't code for applause. I code because silence was never an option.
Every commit is a scar healed. Every repo is a refusal to quit.

They said *"you're not enough."* — So I became too much.

### What I Do

Backend is home. Fullstack is the battlefield.
I architect systems that don't go down — because the people depending on them can't afford that.

### EduFreed — *Because African schools deserve better.*

> A fully-managed school management system built for African schools.
> No hosting. No servers. No IT teams. Just log in and run.

Schools across Africa shouldn't need a tech department to function in the modern world.
**EduFreed** strips away every barrier between a school and its operations.

```
  Student & Staff Management     Results & Attendance
  Fees & Communication           Zero-Maintenance SaaS
```

*Built for schools that were told technology wasn't for them.*
*We disagreed.*

### Xentrius

Co-founder. Not a title — a war I chose.
Building infrastructure where others saw nothing worth building for.

*Some people build to create. I build to prove a point.*2
