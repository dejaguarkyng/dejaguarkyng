They didn't break me. They made me.

# I am dejaguarkyng.

*Not a product of encouragement. A product of being told I couldn't.*

### The world gave me closed doors. So I learned to write my own.

I don't code for applause. I code because silence was never an option.
Every commit is a scar healed. Every repo is a refusal to quit.

They said *"you're not enough."* — So I became too much.

```
   STATUS:     Unapologetic
   ORIGIN:     From nothing
   DIRECTION:  Forward. Always forward.
   FUEL:       Every doubt they ever had
```

*Some people build to create. I build to prove a point.*
*And the point has already been made.*
